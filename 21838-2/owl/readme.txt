bfo-2020.owl and bfo-2020.ofn correspond to ISO/IEC:21838-2 A.1.2-3, formatted as RDF/XML and the Functional-style Syntax, respectively.
bfo-2020-without-some-all-times.owl corresponds only to ISO/IEC:21838-2 A.1.2
bfo-2020-labeled.ofn is a transformation of bfo-2020.ofn that can be more easily read, in which the IRIs are replaced with the corresponding labels.

NOTE: The OWL is an approximation to the FOL theory, which is stronger. As an approximation it is incomplete, not only wrt. to the FOL, but also in the sense that there are potentially provably true OWL axioms that are not part of this version of the OWL. The BFO specification says that any and only OWL axioms that are provable from the FOL are valid for BFO OWL. It is intended that OWL file will become more complete over time. Feel free to add FOL provable OWL axioms to your version, and please submit an issue to https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020/issues with them so they can be added to the distributed version.
