# Directory Structure

This directory contains Common Logic (CL) implementations of Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). 

**Common Logic** is a framework for a family of first-order logical languages, specified in [ISO/IEC 24707:2018](https://www.iso.org/standard/66249.html), is designed for use in the representation and interchange of disparate data sources, and is specified in three dialects, one of which - **Common Logic Interchange Format** (CLIF) - is adopted here.

Files in this directory reflect moduralization of BFO into sub-theories, namely:
- Declarations of universals
- Mereological relationships among continuants
- Mereological relationships among occurrents
- Generically dependent contiuants and generic dependence relationships
- Specifically dependent continuants and specific dependence relationships
- Material entities, objects, object aggregates, and fiat object parts
- Histories and their relationships to material entities
- Spatial Regions and the occupation of these regions
- Temporal Regions and the occupation of these regions
- Spatiotemporal Regions and the occupation of these regions
- Participation between continuants and processes
- Precedence relationships across temporal regions
- Existence between entities and temporal regions
