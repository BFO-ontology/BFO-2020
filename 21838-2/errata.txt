This file collects errata in FOL for 21838-2

================================================================
Errata #1

There is an axiom that states that at every time a process exists it has a participant.

In the common logic version, the second comment was accidentally copied from another axiom.

Original, in participation.cl:

(cl:comment 'label:process-always-has-participant')
(cl:comment 'if b has_participant c at t then b and c exists at t')
(forall (p t)
 (if (instance-of p process t) (exists (c) (participates-in c p t))))

Corrected second comment should read:

(cl:comment 'At every time a process exists it has a participant')

In participation.pdf, the comment is used to title the axioms

Original:

(2) If b has_participant c at t then b and c exists at t

Corrected: 

(2) At every time a process exists it has a participant

In participation.p9 

Original, Line 12:
% if b has_participant c at t then b and c exists at t

Should read:

% At every time a process exists it has a participant

The comment does not appear in the OWL version.

Errata #2

The axiom for specific-dependent participation is missing a clause

(cl:comment 'label:participation-of-specific-dependent-continuant')
(cl:comment 'At every time a specific dependent s participates in a process p there''s a part of that time, during which there''s an independent-continuant that s s-depends on, and that participates in p at that time')
(forall (sdc p t)
 (if
  (and (instance-of sdc specifically-dependent-continuant t)
   (participates-in sdc p t))
  (exists (tp ic)
   (and (instance-of tp temporal-region tp)
    (instance-of ic independent-continuant tp)
    (not (instance-of ic spatial-region tp))
    (specifically-depends-on sdc ic) (participates-in ic p tp)))))

It should read

(forall (sdc p t)
 (if
  (and (instance-of sdc specifically-dependent-continuant t)
   (participates-in sdc p t))
  (exists (tp ic)
   (and (instance-of tp temporal-region tp)
--->    (temporal-part-of tp t)
    (instance-of ic independent-continuant tp)
    (not (instance-of ic spatial-region tp))
    (specifically-depends-on sdc ic) (participates-in ic p tp)))))
