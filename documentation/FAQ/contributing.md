# Contributing to BFO 2020 Repository

Engagement in discussions of major and minor concerns, errata, potential substantial changes, clarifications, etc., typically occurs in this project's [Discussion Page](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020/discussions/landing). If, following discussion, it becomes clear that one or more changes are needed to repository content, this is communicated through this project's [Issues Page](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020/issues). There users will find templates to help convey the nature of the issue as well as ways it can be addressed. Issues can be resolved by the creation of a pull request to update the repository. Please refer to the FAQ directory, in particular, [FAQ/github-workflow-and-pull-requests.md](FAQ/github-workflow-and-pull-requests.md) for guidance on creating Pull Requests.

Users are welcome to raise any issue they like outside of the above process, of course, but we find that having brief disucussion first helps keep separate interesting discussions from issues to be addressed.

## Issue Resolution

Once an issue has been created, anyone can comment on it, vote, suggest changes, etc. To resolve issues, we adopt the Apache voting system, which is to say:
   - **+1** Agree
   - **-1** Strongly Disagree (this vote should be accompanied by an alternative solution)
   - **+0** Neutral
   - Silence is assent

Users are welcome to contribute to discussion without voting.

If an issue receives any **-1** votes, the comments on the issue must be resolved by consensus before the issue can be resolved one way or the other. There is no strict time limit for issues under contention.

## Pull Request Resolution

A pull request is ready to merge when it satisfies the following conditions:
   - At least two **+1** votes
   - No **-1** votes
   - Has been opened for at least 3 business days

We often waive the 3 days requirement for cosmetic-only changes.
