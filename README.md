# Basic Formal Ontology
This repository maintains the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) artifact conformant to the requirements specified in [ISO/IEC 21838â€‘1](https://www.iso.org/standard/71954.html) for top-level ontologies. The most current version is the one in the master branch.

BFO contains classes and relations representing content common to all areas of scientific investigation, e.g. object, process, etc. and is used as a top-level architecture by numerous ontologies in the Open Biomedical and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry, the Industrial Ontologies Foundry (IOF), and the Common Core Ontologies suite. Ontologies conformant to BFO promote interoperability, standardization, and reuse among domain-level ontologies.
