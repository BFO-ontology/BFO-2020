# Directory Structure

This directory contains Prover9 implementations of Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as well as two versions of a consistent model: one in Prover9's native syntax and one in clausetester format. 

**Prover9** is first-order automated theorem prover, developed by [William McCune](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/prover9/), a version of which can be found [here](https://github.com/ai4reason/Prover9). Files in this directory are used to automatically verify various formal properties and theorems of BFO. 

Files in this directory reflect moduralization of BFO into sub-theories, namely:
- Declarations of universals
- Mereological relationships among continuants
- Mereological relationships among occurrents
- Generically dependent contiuants and generic dependence relationships
- Specifically dependent continuants and specific dependence relationships
- Material entities, objects, object aggregates, and fiat object parts
- Histories and their relationships to material entities
- Spatial Regions and the occupation of these regions
- Temporal Regions and the occupation of these regions
- Spatiotemporal Regions and the occupation of these regions
- Participation between continuants and processes
- Precedence relationships across temporal regions
- Existence between entities and temporal regions

Release notes are available in the top level directory "release-notes"
