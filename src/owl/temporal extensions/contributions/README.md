# Contributions

The files in this directory are not part of the bfo-core.owl distribution
but are intended as potentially useful additions. 

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome as long as they are licensed with CC-BY 4 or
later or with a compatible open source license. Please submit an issue if
you would like to add a contribution. Contributions in CLIF or OWL are
encouraged. All contributions should be verified to be consistent with one of the first-order implementations of BFO, namely, the collection of [CLIF](https://www.iso.org/standard/66249.html) sub-theories or the collection of sub-theories in Prover9 syntax. If you need help with that, please solicit assistance on the [Discussion Page](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO-2020/discussions/landing).
